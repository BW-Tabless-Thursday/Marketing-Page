## The Team
* Christian Pelayo (Project Manager)
* Oksana Kril (React II Dev)
* Warren Rawlings (React I Dev)
* Elijah Mandeville (Web UI Dev)
* David White (Web UI Dev)

## Mission
Our goal was to create a fully responsive website using the latest Boostrap framework. The react team worked to create the web app while the web UI team created the marketing page.

## Technologies Used
* Bootstrap 4: We leveraged the awesome capabilities of this frameworked and linked to the CDN to let us use Less
* Less: To create DRY css files that compile down to the linked `index.css` file
* HTML 5 & JavaScript: For the main page functionality
